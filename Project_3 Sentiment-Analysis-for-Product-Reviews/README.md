# Sentiment Analysis for Product Reviews
For project 3, I will be perfroming a Natural Language Processing(NLP) workload by analyzing a dataset of product reviews for an E-commerce. 
The goal is to build a sentiment analysis model that can classify reviews into three categories: Positive, Neutral and Negative. After that, 
I will be creating a sentiment dashboard using Google Data Studio.

## Tools 
The following tools were used for different areas of the project:
* Python Libraries: `Pandas` `Seaborn` `matplotlib` `word cloud`
* Machine Learning Libraries: `scikit-learn` `joblib`
* Sentiment Dashboard: `Google Data Studio`
* Deployment: `Streamlit`
