# Sentiment Analysis for Product Reviews
For project 3, I will be performing a Natural Language Processing(NLP) workload by analyzing a dataset of product reviews for an E-commerce. 
The goal is to build a sentiment analysis model that can classify reviews into: Positive or Negative.

## Tools 
The following tools were used for different areas of the project:
* Python Libraries: `Pandas` `Seaborn` `matplotlib` `word cloud`
* Machine Learning Libraries: `scikit-learn` `joblib`
* Deployment: `Streamlit`

## Data Insights
With the use of pythonn libraries  `seaborn` and `matplotlib` to perform data visualization in the notebook, the following were discovered:
* More than 50% of the customers gave a positive review about the amazon product(s) they purchased. This proves that majority of the time,
  many of the customers are satisfied with their purchase.
* The business recorded its highest level of satisfied purchases due to the positive reviews left by the customers. The positive reviews surpassed the negative ones with a great margin.
