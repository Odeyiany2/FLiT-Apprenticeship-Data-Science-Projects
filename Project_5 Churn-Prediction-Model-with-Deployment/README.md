# Churn Prediction Model for a Telecommunications Company
The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer is likely to churn and deploying our machine learning 
model for real world use with the help of Heroku. 

Customer churn refers to the percentage of customers who stopped purchasing a business
product or rather service in our case, during a period of time.

This project is about understanding why customers leave a business service and also able to predict which customer will leave the service. 


## Tools
* `Github`: for accessing jupyter notebook for coding (data preprocessing, model training and evaluation) and a repo for documentation.
  
* `Python Libraries`:
  - `Pandas`: for data analysis and manipulation
  - `Seaborn`: for high level data visualizations
  - `Scikit Learn`: for ML algorithms
    
* `Heroku`: a cloud platform that simplifies the deployment process of our model
