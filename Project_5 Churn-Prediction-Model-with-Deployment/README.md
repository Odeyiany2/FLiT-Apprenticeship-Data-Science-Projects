# Churn Prediction Model for a Telecommunications Company
The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer is likely to churn and deploying our machine learning 
model for real world use with the help of Heroku. 

Customer churn refers to the percentage of customers who stopped purchasing a business
product or rather service in our case, during a period of time.

This project is about understanding why customers leave a business service and also able to predict which customer will leave the service. 


## Tools
* `Github`: for accessing jupyter notebook for coding (data preprocessing, model training and evaluation) and a repo for documentation.
  
* `Python Libraries`:
  - `Pandas`: for data analysis and manipulation
  - `Seaborn`: for high level data visualizations
  - `Scikit Learn`: for ML algorithms
    
* `Heroku`: a cloud platform that simplifies the deployment process of our model


## Data Insights
The following are some insights discovered from our dataset.
* `Univariate Analysis`:
  - Our target variable which is the customer's churn has a percentage of 26.5% for customers that churned and73.5% for customers that didn't.
  - The genders in our dataset are equally distributed; 50% Male and 50% Female.
  - Majority of Customers are not Senior Citizens with the exact percentage been 84% for non senior citizens and 16% for senior citizens
  - Over 3500 of customers have a month to month contract with the company.
  - Majority of customers, above 4500 of them do not have dependents.
  - Over 6000 of customers have phone service.
  - Internet Service Distribution is as follows: 44% use Fiber optic, 34% use DSL, and 22% do not use any internet service.
