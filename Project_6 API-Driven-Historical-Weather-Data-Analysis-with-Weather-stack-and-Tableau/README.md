# API Driven Historical Weather Data Analysis with Weather Stack and Tableau


Project 6 is an interesting one and it is a dynamic project that merges data analysis, API intergration and data driven visualizations. For this project I will be fetching a historical weather data for various locations using a weatherstack API. After extraction, I will store the data in a database and then perform data analysis before going further to visualize my results. 
Data will be extract using the API key from the weatherstack website under the API documnetation section.

## Tools
The following tools were used in different parts of the project:
* `Python`: using python libraries to extract the data from the weatherstack API
* `PostgreSQL`: serve as a database to store the extracted data
* `Microsoft SQL Server`: used for data analysis
* `Tableau`: for data visualiations
