# Hotel Reservation Analysis in SQL and Tableau

The provided dataset contains information about hotel reservations at two types of hotels: Resort Hotels (H1) and City Hotels (H2).
The goal is to explore the dataset, identify interesting patterns, and create impactful visualizations to tell a compelling data story. This directory will contain my SQL query and a link to my published Tableau visualization.

## Tools used for Analysis
* `SQL Environment` - For Data Manipulation
* `Tableau` - For Data Visualization
* `Github` - For Documentation and code

## Process Structure
**1. Data Importation and Exploration:**
- Import the provided hotel reservation dataset for exploration into my preferred SQL environment(SQL Server)
- Using SQL server will help to easily manage the large data we have and help with the handling of complex queries.

**2. SQL Analysis:**
- Use SQL for data manipulation and analysis.

**3. Tableau Visualization:**
- Create visualizations in Tableau based on my findings from the SQL analysis and publish. 

**4. GitHub Repository:**
- Maintain a GitHub repository with all my queries and a link to my Dashboard.
